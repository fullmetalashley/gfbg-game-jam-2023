TESS: Morning, sunshine. Glad to see you had no trouble finding the place.
TESS: Though I guess the smell of that old house blend is hard to miss.
TESS: Your cousins always told me I smelled like coffee when I'd come home. That and how corny the name is. Greene Beans.
TESS: But anyway, I suppose we should get down to business before customers start rolling in.
TESS: Greenevillers are a different breed. Some of 'em can't form a sentence before their first cup of coffee, but the second that caffeine hits, oh, they don't stop chatting!
TESS: And that's where you come in. I'll teach you how to brew, but I can't teach you to be a good conversationalist. That you gotta learn on your own.
TESS: Otto always tells me those one cup machines are bound to put me outta business one day, but I'm still here. Don't underestimate a good cup of joe...and good company.
TESS: Folks here are nice. I'm sure you'll settle in quick.
TESS: Still, mind what you say and how you respond to customers. Sticks and stones can break our bones, but words can hurt us too.
TESS: On top of keeping the coffee brewing and the conversation going, there're a few other things you need to do here to keep Greene Beans runnin' throughout the day.
TESS: It's all real simple, don't worry. Keep the counter clean, sweep up every now and then, take out the trash, easy things like that.
TESS: I'm sure you'll get the hang of it in no time. Jim's usually first one in and he's always real simple. House blend with two sugars and he'll talk your ear off.
TESS: I'll be in the back if you need me.

JIM: Mornin'! Well, now, you must be Tess'...let's see...sister's kid, right?
JIM: Name's Jim. Jim Larson. Nice to meetcha. Heard all about ya from Tess and Otto.
JIM: They've been real lost without Fern and Jay around. But they both perked right up when you said you were comin' to town.
JIM: What made you decide to come? Not much around here for a young person and your parents aren't from here either.

-> It's cheaper to live here.
    JIM: Sure is. One of the cheapest places in the Midwest. But no young people want to move out here to the sticks. Too boring. Not enough to do.
-> I wanted to escape the rat race.
    JIM: Yeah, but when you're young, you gotta pay your dues. Work hard. And remember, there's rats no matter where you go.
-> My aunt and uncle always made it sound so nice.
    JIM: You must be close with them. Greeneville is a nice place. Quiet. Most times anyway.
-> It's temporary until I figure out what I'm doing.
    JIM: Yeah, I guess no young person'd move here by choice, huh?

JIM: Well, I'm sure you'll get used to Greeneville in no time.
JIM: Don't suppose Tess told you how I like my coffee, did she?

-> House blend, two sugars.
    JIM: You betcha. Been the same order every day. Tess says she can set her watch by me, I'm a man of routine.
    <<set $Jim_A to 2>>
-> Black.
    JIM: I may be in old man, but I've had enough bitterness for one lifetime. I like a little sweetness to start off my day. House blend, two sugars, if you don't mind.
    <<set $Jim_A to 1>>
-> Two creams, two sugars.
    JIM: Tess must be getting my order confused with Shirley's again. My wife wasn't even a coffee drinker before she met me. Hot tea. Still has it sometimes before bed. One of those fancy teas. Camel-something.
    JIM: Anyway, I like the house blend. Two sugars, please.

ANNOUNCER: And now for the weather...
ANNOUNCER: A heavy March snow is expected to begin tonight and last through Thursday. Decreased visibility in the area of...
JIM: Tch. Til Thursday? Can't have that now, can we?
JIM: Got too much to do this week.
JIM: At least, my working days are behind me. No more havin' to haul all those logs down up and down those tiny back roads.
JIM: They say retirement is supposed to be your golden years, but I got a bad back and I'm busier'n ever. Guess it's more like fool's gold, eh?
JIM: Fifty years in the loggin' industry. I started goin' to work with my old man when I was still in school. When something's as much in your blood as these woods are in mine, it's hard to let it go, though.
JIM: Welp, I better be on my way. Retired or not, suppose I can't wile the whole day away here, even if the company's as good as the coffee. See ya tomorrow.

TESS: How'd it go with Jim? I usually come out to say hello, but I wanted to give you a chance to get to know each other.
TESS: He and your uncle go way back. Ol' Jim's what you might call a fixture around here. Always has been.
TESS: Did I hear them say snow tomorrow? Guess you didn't get a lot of March snow back home, did ya?

-> I'm ready for it. My car, not so much.
    TESS: We can get Otto to take a look at it later. He may not look it, but your uncle's pretty handy.
-> I live for snow.
    TESS: Oh, you say that now. I hope you brought your snow boots.
-> Maybe I'll just stay home with some cocoa tonight.
    TESS: Just make sure you dig out so you can get in tomorrow. Rain or snow, storm or shine, Greene Beans is always open.

TESS: Well, I better be getting back to it.
